# esp32_cleargrass_gateway
Build a esp32 wifi gateway that collects cleargrass thermometer data

This is a gateway that uses an esp32 for collecting bluetooth data of the cleargrass e-ink thermometer. The collected data can be retrieved via a wifi webinterface as json data structure which makes the integration to other systems (smarthome / etc.) quite simple.
